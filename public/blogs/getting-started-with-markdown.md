Markdown is a lightweight markup language for creating formatted text using a plain-text editor. It's widely used for documentation, blogging, and note-taking.

## Basic Syntax

- **Bold:** `**bold**`
- **Italic:** `*italic*`
- **Lists:** Use `-` or `*` for bullet lists, `1.` for numbered lists.
- **Links:** `[text](url)`
- **Images:** `![alt](url)`
- **Code:** Inline ``code`` or code blocks:

```js
console.log('Hello, Markdown!');
```

## Why Use Markdown?

- Easy to write and read
- Converts to HTML
- Supported by many platforms (GitHub, Notion, etc.)
